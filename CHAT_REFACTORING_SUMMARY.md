# Chat Section React Query v5 Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored all chat-related API calls from direct usage to React Query v5 hooks. This improves data fetching, caching, and state management across the chat functionality.

## Files Modified

### 1. Created `hooks/useChat.ts`
**New file** containing all React Query v5 hooks for chat operations:

- **`useChatList(token, locale, limit, page)`**: Query hook for fetching chat list
- **`useOpenChat()`**: Mutation hook for opening a new chat
- **`useDeleteChat()`**: Mutation hook for deleting a chat
- **`useMessages(chatId, token, locale, limit, page, search)`**: Query hook for fetching messages
- **`useUploadAttachment()`**: Mutation hook for uploading file attachments
- **`useBlockUser()`**: Mutation hook for blocking a user
- **`useUnblockUser()`**: Mutation hook for unblocking a user

### 2. Refactored `components/shared/header/ChatBox.tsx`
**Major refactoring** - Replaced all manual state management and direct API calls:

**Removed:**
- Manual `useState` for loading, error, and data states
- Direct API calls using `useEffect`
- Manual error handling with try-catch blocks
- Manual token retrieval from localStorage

**Added:**
- React Query hooks for all operations
- Automatic loading and error states from React Query
- Proper cache invalidation on mutations
- Simplified component logic

**Key Changes:**
- Replaced `fetchChatList()` with `useChatList()` hook
- Replaced manual message fetching with `useMessages()` hook
- Replaced manual delete/block/unblock operations with mutation hooks
- Replaced manual file upload with `useUploadAttachment()` hook
- Simplified state management by leveraging React Query's built-in states

### 3. Refactored `components/ActionButtons.tsx`
**Minor refactoring** - Updated chat opening functionality:

**Changes:**
- Replaced direct `openChat()` import with `useOpenChat()` hook
- Added proper error handling and success callbacks
- Integrated with authentication context

### 4. Refactored `components/AdCreatorCard.tsx`
**Minor refactoring** - Updated chat opening functionality:

**Changes:**
- Replaced direct `openChat()` import with `useOpenChat()` hook
- Added proper error handling and success callbacks
- Integrated with authentication context

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Automatic Caching**
- Chat list and messages are automatically cached
- Reduces unnecessary API calls
- Improves user experience with faster loading

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- Centralized error handling in hooks
- Consistent error states across components
- Better user feedback

### 3. **Optimistic Updates**
- Cache invalidation ensures data freshness
- Automatic background refetching
- Real-time data synchronization

### 4. **Simplified State Management**
- Removed manual loading/error states
- React Query handles all async states automatically
- Cleaner component code

### 5. **Type Safety**
- All hooks are properly typed
- Better TypeScript integration
- Reduced runtime errors

## API Functions Refactored

All functions from `lib/chat.ts` are now consumed through React Query hooks:

1. **`getChatList`** → `useChatList()`
2. **`openChat`** → `useOpenChat()`
3. **`deleteChat`** → `useDeleteChat()`
4. **`getMessages`** → `useMessages()`
5. **`uploadAttachment`** → `useUploadAttachment()`
6. **`blockUser`** → `useBlockUser()`
7. **`unblockUser`** → `useUnblockUser()`

## Cache Strategy

- **Chat List**: 30-second stale time, 5-minute garbage collection
- **Messages**: 10-second stale time, 2-minute garbage collection
- **Mutations**: Automatic cache invalidation on success
- **Dependent Queries**: Enabled only when required parameters are available

## Real-time Integration

The refactoring maintains compatibility with the existing socket.io real-time chat functionality:
- Socket events still work as before
- React Query handles the initial data loading
- Real-time updates continue to work seamlessly

## Testing Considerations

- All existing functionality preserved
- Error states properly handled
- Loading states improved
- Cache invalidation working correctly
- Real-time features unaffected

## Next Steps

The chat section is now fully refactored to use React Query v5. All API calls are centralized in hooks, providing better performance, caching, and error handling while maintaining the existing real-time functionality.
